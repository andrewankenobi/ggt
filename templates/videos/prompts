The way you make me feel: 
He'll be performing a classic from Michael Jackson, 'The Way You Make Me Feel,' knowing it's a favorite of judges Dave Grohl and Alanis Morissette. He's hoping to hit the mark, but can't help feeling nervous about performing in front of his musical hero, judge Billie Joe Armstrong. He's dedicating this one to Sara Bareilles, another judge tonight. He's had a crush on her for the longest time, and if all goes well, he’s hoping it might just lead to a date!

Somebody to love:
He'll be performing an acoustic rendition of 'Somebody to Love' by Queen, which, if he's not mistaken, is a favorite of judges Billie Joe Armstrong and Dave Grohl. In a fun twist, he's tweaking the lyrics to 'find some data to flow,' paying homage to his day job as a data engineer.  He's dedicating this one to Sara Bareilles, one of the judges tonight. He's had a crush on her for the longest time, and who knows—if all goes well, he might even hope for a date!
