Google Data Engineer from London,  originally from Italy! 

He'll be performing a classic from Michael Jackson in an acoustic style. He's dedicating this one to Sara Bareilles, one of the judges tonight. He's had a crush on her for the longest time, and hopes this performance expresses what he's always wanted to say. And who knows—if all goes well, he might even hope for a date!

He'll be performing 'Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)' by Green Day, his all-time favorite song by none other than judge Billie Joe Armstrong. While he hopes Billie won't mind, he's dedicating this one to another judge tonight—Sara Bareilles. He's had a crush on her for the longest time, and hopes this performance finally expresses what he's always wanted to say. And who knows—if all goes well, maybe a date could be in the cards!

He'll be performing an acoustic rendition of 'Somebody to Love' by Queen, which, if he's not mistaken, is a favorite of judges Billie Joe Armstrong and Dave Grohl. In a fun twist, he's tweaking the lyrics to 'find some data to flow,' paying homage to his day job as a data engineer.  He's dedicating this one to Sara Bareilles, one of the judges tonight. He's had a crush on her for the longest time, and who knows—if all goes well, he might even hope for a date!
