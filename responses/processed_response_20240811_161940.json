He's a software engineer by day, but tonight he's hoping to debug his love life. Andrea will be performing a heartfelt rendition of 'Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)' by Green Day, dedicated to none other than Sara Bareilles! Let's see if he'll be saying 'good riddance' to single life after this.",
